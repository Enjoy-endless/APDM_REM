# APDM_REM

*A Implementation of Patch Detection and Random Erasing Defense Against Adversarial Patches

##1. Introduction

A simple yet effective defense mechanism that can defend against patch attacks both on image classiﬁcation and object detection, from the perspective of adversarial image preprocessing and the robustness of the network. 

APDM is used for detecting and locating the adversarial patches in the image and can be regarded as a defense preprocessing against patch attacks. 

REM is responsible for training more robust image classiﬁcation and object detection networks, and has a general defense against adversarial patches.
