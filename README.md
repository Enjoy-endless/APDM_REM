# APDM_REM

 We propose a simple yet effective defense mechanism that can defend against patch attacks both on image classiﬁcation and object detection, from the perspective of adversarial image preprocessing and the robustness of the network. The defense mechanism consists of an Adversarial Patch Detection Module (APDM) and a Random Erasing Module (REM). APDM is used for detecting and locating the adversarial patches in the image and can be regarded as a defense preprocessing against patch attacks. REM is responsible for training more robust image classiﬁcation and object detection networks, and has a general defense against adversarial patches. Our evaluation on LFW, Pascal VOC, and ImageNet suggests that the effectiveness and transferability of the proposed method against different patch attacks. 

For patch attacks, we consider the defense mechanism from the perspective of adversarial image preprocessing and the robustness of the network, and propose a defense mechanism is shown in Fig.1. The defense mechanism consists of two modules: APDM and REM. For adversarial images generated by different patch attacks on image classiﬁcation and object detection, ﬁrst use the APDM to detects and locates the adversarial patches, then replace the adversarial patches with the gray patches. Finally, the replaced images are input to the robust model trained by REM, and the detection and classiﬁcation results are output.
