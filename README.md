# APDM_REM

 We propose a simple yet effective defense4 mechanism that can defend against patch attacks both on image classiﬁcation and5 object detection, from the perspective of adversarial image preprocessing and the6 robustness of the network. The defense mechanism consists of an Adversarial7 Patch Detection Module (APDM) and a Random Erasing Module (REM). APDM8 is used for detecting and locating the adversarial patches in the image and can be9 regarded as a defense preprocessing against patch attacks. REM is responsible for10 training more robust image classiﬁcation and object detection networks, and has a11 general defense against adversarial patches. Our evaluation on LFW, Pascal VOC,12 and ImageNet suggests that the effectiveness and transferability of the proposed13 method against different patch attacks.
